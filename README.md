## 1.Write a C program to create a main process named ‘parent_process’ having 3child processes without any grandchildren processes.Trace parent and child processes in the process tree.Show that child processes are doing addition, subtraction and multiplication on two variables initialized in the parent_process.

## 2.Write a program to create an orphan process.

## 3.Write a program to create a zombie process.

## 4.Write a C program to create a main process named ‘parent_process’ having 3child processes without any grandchildren processes. Child Processes’ names are child_1, child_2, child_3. Trace the position in the process tree.

## 5.Write a C program to create a main process named ‘parent_process’ having ‘n’ child processes without any grandchildren processes. Child Processes’ names are child_1, child_2, child_3,......., child_n. Trace the position in the process tree. Number of child processes (n) and name of child processes will be given in the CLI of Linux based systems. Example: $ ./parent_process 3 child_1 child_2 child_3 Hint: fork, exec, fopen, system

## 5. execlp() system call to replace process memory image

## 6. Standard and File read/write using system call

## 7. Race condition in multithreading (global and local variable)

## 8. Mutex

## 9. Semaphore

## 10. Named and Ordinary (Unnamed) pipe

## 11. Chatroom using named pipe

## 12. IPC using shared memory

## 13. CPU management like set_cpu(), get_cpu()

## 14. Priority and Niceness

## 15. Signal handling

## 16. Stack smashing

## 17. Page replacement algorithms (FIFO, LRU, OPT)
